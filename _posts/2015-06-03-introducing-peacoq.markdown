What is PeaCoq?
---------------

Over the past year, I have developed a Coq frontend called PeaCoq (not to be
mistaken with Yves Bertot's [Pcoq][Pcoq]). If
you wish to play with it before or while reading this article, I made an online
version available [here][PeaCoq]. Note that it will reset
after 15 minutes of inactivity, and that it might go down any time!

There have been several attempts at improving user interfaces for proof
assistants, so I will describe here some of PeaCoq's features. I built PeaCoq
with the goal of helping both novice and more advanced users. I chose to build
it as a web-based text editor, so that it was easy to have people try it. The
client-server architecture means PeaCoq users only need a web browser to
interact with a Coq session hosted on the server. Unfortunately, this means
PeaCoq does not run in your favorite text editor.

The main feature of PeaCoq is its tree mode. Whenever you enter a proof, the
interface splits into this view:

![PeaCoq tree]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-tree.png)

The top part of the screen has your editor on the left, and a buffer for errors
on the right. The bottom part shows your current proof context in the leftmost
rectangle, a tactic in the purple node, and the resulting proof context in the
right rectangle.

In the next sections, I will discuss two features of PeaCoq: the automated trial
of tactics in the background, and the highlighting of the differences between
proof contexts.

Automatically trying tactics
----------------------------

Like most programming languages, learning Coq requires making yourself familiar
with a vernacular of syntactic elements and their proper grammar. In fact, Coq
has three languages whose interaction is crucial to achieve anything:

- Vernacular, the language used to introduce constructs and change meta-level
  properties

- Gallina, the language used to define computational behaviors

- Ltac, the language used to interact with proof contexts.

Learning these three languages can be overwhelming. To bridge some of this "gap
of execution", PeaCoq can try tactics in the background, and display the results
to the user. We only show the result of tactics that succeed and actually modify
the context. This way, we avoid displaying tactics that may succeed yet do
nothing, like `firstorder`.

The first challenge here is to pick a suitable set of tactics to try. Some
tactics are benign to try all the time, while some tactics can take a very long
time to succeed or fail. So far, we have only used a set of curated tactics, and
try them in order of their expected complexity.

Now, most tactics have a plethora of arguments and variants that are sometimes
useful, sometimes necessary to use in order to make progress. For instance,
introduction tactics let you specify names or even deconstruction
patterns. Rewrite tactics let you specify which occurence of the unified pattern
to actually perform the rewrite on. Existential tactics need you to provide an
existential witness. It is unclear how to cater for all of these. By default,
PeaCoq will only try very simple things: it will not name introduced variables,
it will try all rewrites in all directions for all names in local context, over
all hypotheses and the goal. This quickly grows big, though in practice many of
these tactics immediately fail.

Another problem is in displaying the succesful tactics. There usually are many
succesful tactics, with often redundant results. In order to display sometimes
dozens of goals, PeaCoq groups them in a two-dimensional fashion. So far, we
group tactics by their purpose (introduction tactics, rewrite tactics, solvers,
etc.).

Highlighting differences between proof contexts
-----------------------------------------------

Here the problem seems simple. Assuming you have parsed the proof context before
and after running a tactic, I would like to identify a set of differences. These
differences can be:

- the appearance or disappearance of a hypothesis
- the reordering of a hypothesis
- a set of structural changes within a hypothesis or the goal

where the last two may overlap. Here is an example of the visualization of such
a changeset:

![PeaCoq diff]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-diff.png)

The red, shrinking streams indicate hypotheses that disappear. The blue stream
indicates the repositioning of a hypothesis. The orange patches indicate changes
in the structure of a term.

Computing the streams is not too difficult. The interesting part is in computing
differences within terms.

There has been some research on computing differences between abstract syntax
trees, mostly in order to highlight changes between versions of software. They
are somewhat too complicated for our intent as they often also compute code
movement.

The naïve approach here is to compute similarity top-down and highlight subnodes
of the AST that differ. This is a good first approximation, but it may give some
non-intuitive results. For instance, consider the simplification step from:

{% highlight coq %}
concat (cons n l) nil
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight coq %}
cons n (concat l nil)
{% endhighlight %}

This algorithm would see that the top-level node is an application node on both
sides, and would recursively highlight `concat (cons n l)` as being different
from `cons n`, and `nil` as being different from `(concat l nil)` (remember,
function application is left-associative). This is often confusing because the
entire term looks different, and the fact that the application node is still an
application node is somewhat insignificant. In these situations we want to lift
the difference to the entire application.

This still leaves an issue. Consider the following:

![PeaCoq diff too smart]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-diff-too-smart.png)

Even though the algorithm is precise in identifying that only the function being
applied and its second argument have changed, this diff is somewhat misleading
as to the semantics of `rewrite`. It might be better to highlight the entire
expression `f a b` as modified. I am currently toying with this idea, thinking
of bubbling differences whenever a nested application has both a modified
functional term and a modified argument. The bubbling could propagate all the
way to the last modified argument. Of course, it would over-approximate cases
where the tactic actually intended to modify only these two precise locations. I
don't know if this is often the case.

A last concern is the detection of generalization or instantiation of
quantifiers. The current algorithm flags the entire term as different whenever
the top-most node in the AST differs, which is unfortunate for quantifier
instantiation when the resulting subgoal is a subterm of the original subgoal or
vice-versa. Ideally, I would find the matching subtree, and somehow indicate
visually that only the quantifier has disappeared.

Evaluating PeaCoq for novices
-----------------------------

I have been trying to evaluate PeaCoq since January. During the winter quarter,
[Zachary Tatlock][Zach] taught the
[graduate programming languages class][CSE505] at University of Washington using
PeaCoq as the in-class editor and as an option for students.

[CSE505]: http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse505/15wi/
[Zach]: http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/

Students were overall positive about PeaCoq, even though the version they use
was very unstable and undergoing development while they were working with
it. Some students chose not to use PeaCoq, either because they already had their
own ProofGeneral setup, or because they had a bad experience with PeaCoq. At
that time, the editor was primitive, the proof tree feature was very brittle,
and it was impossible to switch in and out of the proof tree mode on the
fly. Many of these problems are now solved!

While this was overall a positive experience, I felt I needed more conclusive
evidence of the help provided by PeaCoq for beginners, so I set up an A-B
study. I recruited 20 graduate students, randomly assigned pairs of them into
one of two groups, and had them work through a one-hour lecture followed by a
one-hour exercise session. Group A was to perform the exercises in a
ProofGeneral setting, while group B used PeaCoq's trees. Here is the averaged
data per exercise.

![PeaCoq A/B study]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-ab-study.png)

As you can see, the data is fairly inconclusive, partly because of flaws of the
study setup. Hours before the study started, I removed a lemma that made
`rev_distributes_over_concat` easier to prove. Students in group A were
extremely stuck, though two pairs found a solution that involved a sequence of
five rewrites. Four out of five pairs in group B found that solution too. After
a long period of time, we unlocked everyone.

Ignoring this exercise, we can notice a few things. In the first exercise, the
control group was much faster than group B! It turns out, some groups got lost
looking at all the options PeaCoq proposed, rather than trying things boldly. On
the other hand, the control group had to try things without any preview, and
therefore tried to apply the same technique as in the in-class exercises, which
was exactly the right way to go.

Another issue that came up was the abundance of spurious options offered by
PeaCoq. For instance, we introduced lemmas like:

{% highlight coq %}
Theorem concat_nil_right : forall l : natlist, concat l nil = l.
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight coq %}
Theorem rev_involutive : forall l : natlist, rev (rev l) = l.
{% endhighlight %}

Therefore, upon mining for rewrite possibilities, PeaCoq would offer many
spurious rewrites, like `rewrite <- concat_nil_right.`, every time a list was in
context. This tactic replaces `l` with `concat l nil`, which, while correct, is
most often not something you would like (unless you wanted to put the goal in
this shape to apply some lemma).

It would be nice to filter such options, either by indicating to PeaCoq that
some rewrites are only helpful in one direction, or by having a smarter metric
for complexity.

`map'_unroll` was very PeaCoq-friendly in that it was a goal that held by
reflexivity while not looking reflexive, and would not simplify by
`simpl`. PeaCoq users were immediately presented with a `reflexivity.` node,
while most of the control group got stuck and asked me what to do.

The latter exercises were only reached by a few pairs of the control group
within the allocated time (thus the null standard deviation).

Overall, while it seemed PeaCoq was very helpful in some places, there were many
confounding factors and places were the options offered by PeaCoq were more
overwhelming than helpful for novices.

I am working on alleviating some of these pitfalls, and hopefully another study
will highlight the benefits of PeaCoq...

Other challenges and features
-----------------------------

- Parsing Coq terms: Up to version 8.4, the protocol used in communicating with
  a coqtop process was fairly terrible. In particular, terms were exchanged as
  strings, which made the kind of techniques used to display term differences
  challenging. My current solution is equally unsatisfactory: I wrote a small
  parser for Coq's syntax. It does not handle everything, in particular
  notations, and so fails to parse many terms. Upon failure, the diff feature
  takes the conservative approach of string comparison.
  Coq 8.5 seems to finally output ASTs, so hopefully PeaCoq could leverage this
  to avoid recomputing all this information!

- Generate robust proofs: ideally, I would like editor support to make my proofs
  more robust. One pitfall when using theorem provers is how boring it is to
  introduce names, but how practical they are to use to quickly refer to
  something. This makes for proofs scripts were names are automatically
  introduced, and are therefore very brittle to small changes. It would be nice
  if the editor could prevent one from using automatically-introduced names, or
  retroactively edit the proof to introduce the name "auto-manually" once it is
  used, by keeping track of where it appeared and when it is used!

- Reducing context clutter: consider the following screenshot, taken from
  somewhere within a proof in CompCert.

![PeaCoq clutter]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-clutter.png)

  So many lines! In my experience, there is little value in having all those
  lines most of the time. In particular, I am often interested in hypotheses
  that have indexed types, and not so much in the others, that are just
  "data". Here is what I envision instead for PeaCoq:

![PeaCoq less clutter]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-less-clutter.png)

  All the variables in context but whose type is of lesser interest have been
  removed. You should be able to access them somehow (maybe by hovering your
  mouse wherever they appear? maybe by some keyboard shortcut query? maybe they
  should still be visible in some folded pane?), but I don't want them in my way
  most of the time. Of course there would be tricky interactions with the diff
  feature.

  I would also like to be able to make hypotheses as "hidden" without
  necessarily hiding them in the proof script.

- Manipulating the structure of terms: Now consider this context.

![PeaCoq folding]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-folding.png)

  This long unfolded term takes the entire screen space. I rarely need to see
  this unfolded version, and PeaCoq knows the structure of the term and has
  built a DOM object with the proper structure, I should be able to have this
  long term be folded, and only unfolded if I want to. I have not implemented
  this yet, but I would like it to look something like:

![PeaCoq folded]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/peacoq-folded.png)

  (Oops, there is a slight but in the stream algorithm!)

- Supporting Coq's evolution: In general, it would be nice to stay up-to-date,
  in particular to support Coq's new background processing mechanism. Now this
  would make for some non backwards-compatible changes, so I'd rather wait until
  the community switches to 8.5.

That's all folks!
